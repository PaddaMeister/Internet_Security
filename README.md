1.An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a network attack in which an unauthorized hacker gains access to a network and stays covert for a long period of time.
2.A backdoor is a method, often secret, of bypassing normal authentication in a product, computer system, cryptosystem or algorithm etc.
3.A botnet (also known as a zombie army) is a number of Internet computers that, although their owners are unaware of it, have been set up to forward transmissions (including spam or viruses) to other computers on the Internet.
4.Brute force (also known as brute force cracking) is a trial and error method used by application programs to decode encrypted data such as passwords or Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys, through exhaustive effort (using brute force) rather than employing intellectual strategies.
5.An exploit is a software tool designed find weaknesses in a computer system, usually for malicious intent such as installing malware.
A keylogger is a computer program that records every keystroke made by a computer user, which is then used to gain access to passwords among other things.
7.A macro virus is a computer virus that "infects" an application and causes a sequence of actions to be performed on startup or when something else triggers it. However they are relatively harmless.
8.A port scan attack occurs when an attacker sends packets to another computer, varying the destination port. The attacker uses this to find out what services you are running and to get a pretty good idea of the operating system you have. Most Internet sites get a dozen or more port scans per day.
9.Tabjacking is a new form of malware that can enter your PC through vulnerabilities in your Web browser that allow hackers to insert malicious code into the tabs of your Web browser. The code is capable of hijacking the tab to a new Web page and inserting advertising pop-ups, worms, trojans, or other malware into your PC.
10.Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid or demands are met.
11.A rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or areas of its software that would not otherwise be allowed (for example, to an unauthorized user) and often masks its existence or the existence of other software
12.A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. Often, it uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security weaknesses on the target computer to access it.
13.A Zero-Day attack Derives from or relating to a previously unknown vulnerability to attack in some software.
14.A zombie is a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or trojan horse program and can be used to perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction.
